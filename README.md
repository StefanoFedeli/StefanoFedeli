### üôå Successes
##### Data Science
After a couple of working experiences in the medical industry [in 2019 as Data Analyst](https://www.asst-brianza.it/web/index.php/presidi/ospedale/vimercate) and [in 2021 as Data Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6761670952150437888-Fuex). I co-founded [Mailo Global](https://mailo.global) with other 4 great people to bring AI into Real-World evidence.  

##### Blockchain
Having been fooled more than once I started sharing my view and my tips on this far west. Excited for the impact this technology can have. I started by being a member of the [Digital Gold Institute](https://dgi.io/full-team/), I moved to Sygnum Bank as a DeFi Engineer,  building financial products on blockchain. I'm also publishing my adventure on my [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@ing.crypto)!
