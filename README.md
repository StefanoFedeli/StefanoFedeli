### üôå Successes
##### Data Science
After a couple of working experiences in the medical industry [in 2019 as Data Analyst](https://www.asst-brianza.it/web/index.php/presidi/ospedale/vimercate) and [in 2021 as Data Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6761670952150437888-Fuex). I co-founded [Mailo Global](https://mailo.global) with other 4 great people to bring AI into Real-World evidence. I later sold my shares to start [GmAnalytics](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matteo-ferrini_python-leagueoflegends-streamlit-activity-7201985378185043968-_hTY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to bring Machine Learning in E-Sports. 

##### Blockchain
Having been fooled more than once, I started sharing my view and my tips on this far west. Excited for the impact this technology can have. I started by being a member of the [Digital Gold Institute](https://dgi.io/full-team/), I moved to Sygnum Bank as a DeFi Engineer, building financial products on blockchain. Dedicated to empower professional growth in the field through [mentorship](https://mentorcruise.com/sessions/mentor/stefanofedeli/) and [courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/stefano-fedeli-3/). Always happy to help people in the industry! 

##### Outside Tech
I love playing football ‚öΩ  and basketball üèÄ. 
I practice the real Yoga from Patanjali üßòüèª.
I love to share stories and thoughts through my podcast [BitEvolution](https://anchor.fm/bitevolution) available on any platform.
